# TheKaggleProject
Data filter project using data pulled from Kaggle's API

First project uploaded, started off simple.

Data is being fetched through Kaggle API to populate the drop down lists.
Both "Enter" key and hitting the "Find" button will execute the function that will calculate the number of customers of a specific gender in a specific city.
Additional functionalities I'm hoping to add:
  1. Ability to check statistical information: Mean, Median, Lowest, Highest
  2. Visualization: A simple pie chart visualization added as a component in the UI.
Using Tkinter as the UI framework was surprisingly intuitive.
